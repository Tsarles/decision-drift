# decision-drift
This project was created as a way for me to practice my JavaScript skills while building something both fun and useful. Decision Drift is a simple, interactive tool that helps users make decisions when they're feeling uncertain. Whether you're trying to pick a place to eat, choose a movie, or make any other everyday decision, this app randomly selects an option from a list of choices you provide.

It was designed with both personal use and sharing with friends in mind. The app can bring a bit of fun and randomness to the decision-making process, and it’s a great tool for those times when you can’t decide on your own!

Feel free to explore the repository, try it out, or even contribute to the project.
